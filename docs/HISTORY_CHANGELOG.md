# UJLP Complete Visual Changelog

This is a visual and historical changelog for the UJLP website from the first commit on `main` through the current `main` head.

Generated from local `main` at `383c3acf` on the 2026-09-12 commit history. The review used a temporary clone, checked out historical `main` source points, ran each version locally, and captured full-page desktop screenshots with headless Chromium.

## Method

- Source of truth: `main`.
- Pre-release cadence: one representative snapshot per active month before `v1.0.0`.
- Release cadence: every tagged release from `v1.0.0` forward.
- Current state: latest `main` after `v3.0.0`.
- Screenshot viewport: 1440 x 1100, full page.
- Screenshot storage: `docs/changelog-assets/history-screenshots/`.
- Quiet months: no `main` commits were found for November 2024 or March 2025.

### Tag note

Most release tags resolve cleanly to source commits on `main`. `v1.0.0` is the exception: its tag points to a deployment artifact on `gh-pages`, while the closest `main` source point had unresolved component imports in the current case-sensitive build environment. For `v1.0.0`, the timeline still uses the nearest `main` source commit for history, but the screenshot uses the actual static release artifact from the tag.

## Evolution Summary

- The site began as a very small Create React App with a narrow content column and basic navigation.
- By mid-2025, it had a recognizable journal identity, author bios, announcements, contact surfaces, and a dark card-based layout.
- The `v1.x` line was mostly about roster growth, profile imagery, article scaffolding, search, PDF entry points, and release polish.
- `v2.0.0` converted the project into a richer feature system with reusable components and stronger article tooling.
- `V2.1.0` moved the app out of `my-app`, cleaned up old structure, and introduced citation/toast interactions.
- `v3.0.0` was the biggest editorial redesign: publication surfaces, journal UI, article pages, mobile polish, and custom domain preservation.
- Current `main` continues that editorial direction with CI cleanup, link repairs, Derek article fixes, and the latest removal of the Mikayla/insanity-defense references.
